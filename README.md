Introduction

Project Moon is an open source project that build up an MP3 Player with Recording function from scratch. All the sources code are opened under GNU LGPLv3 license. The hardware also freely open. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate in highly details guideline that show you how to build your own electronic device (ex. an MP3 Player with customizable feature).

Additionally, this project is non-profit project and powered by PnL team which stand for Programming and Leverage. Currently, I'm the only member of this team - Long Dang.

My credo:

"Let finding 'lý tưởng' and passion. Build your own tech, your style!"
